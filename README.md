# Require Label Bot

[![Downloads][npm-downloads]][npm-url] [![version][npm-version]][npm-url]
[![Build Status][travis-status]][travis-url]

A [Probot](https://probot.github.io) bot to make sure that a given label is added
to specific issues and pull requests when all other labels do not match a regex.

## Setup

Add a `.github/relabel.yml` file to your repository and then run the bot against it.

If the config is empty or doesn't exist, the bot will not run.

```yml
# This example configuration will add the `needs-area` and `needs-type` labels
# to any new issue and pull request that do not have labels matching `area:.*` or `type:.*`.
# Once the issue or the pull request has the `area:.....` label added the `needs-area` label will be 
# removed from the issue or pull request.
issues:
    # The missing label which will be added to issues if the regex doesn't match any other labels
  - missingLabel: needs-area
    regex: area:.*
  - missingLabel: needs-type
    regex: type:.*
pulls:
    # The missing label which will be added to pull requests if the regex doesn't match any other labels
  - missingLabel: needs-area
    regex: area:.*
  - missingLabel: needs-type
    regex: type:.*
```
